# Object-Detection-using-YOLO-and-Vehicle-Counter:
The package used in this project is Yolo package which is used to detect the object in the given input Frame.
After the completion of this project, the proficency and knowledge on the Computer Vision , Deep Learning and python has increased by 60% which helped me in understanding and tackle of real time problem statements.
In this repository the project is about detecting the vechicles (4 wheeler ,2 wheeler) recognise and keep a track of vechile with using a sort package which is used to create unique numbers for the objects detection in the output frames.
Future scope of this project is to detect the number plates and keep the data in the digital form by retrieving data from implementation of the project.
The more updates of the project can be seen in the upcoming projects.
